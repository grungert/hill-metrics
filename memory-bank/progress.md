As the project is in the initialization phase, no components are currently functional. The following has been completed:

1. **Project Documentation**:
   - Project specifications have been documented
   - API endpoints have been defined
   - Database schema has been designed
   - Coding workflow preferences have been established

2. **Memory Bank Initialization**:
   - Core memory bank files have been created
   - Project context and requirements have been documented
   - Technical architecture and patterns have been defined

## Known Issues

As the project is in the initialization phase, there are no known implementation issues. However, several challenges have been identified:

1. **Complex Filtering Requirements**:
   - The application requires sophisticated filtering across multiple dimensions
   - Need to design a flexible and performant filtering system

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**:
   - Financial data can be voluminous, especially historical data
   - Need to ensure good performance even with large datasets

3. **Cross-Asset Comparison**:
   - Different asset types have different attributes and metrics
   - Need to design a system that allows meaningful comparison across asset types

4. **User Experience Complexity**:
   - The application has many features and options
   - Need to ensure the user interface remains intuitive despite the complexity
