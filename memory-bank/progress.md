## Known Issues

As the project is in the initialization phase, there are no known implementation issues. However, several challenges have been identified:

1. **Complex Filtering Requirements**:
   - The application requires sophisticated filtering across multiple dimensions
   - Need to design a flexible and performant filtering system

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**:
   - Financial data can be voluminous, especially historical data
   - Need to ensure good performance even with large datasets

3. **Cross-Asset Comparison**:
   - Different asset types have different attributes and metrics
   - Need to design a system that allows meaningful comparison across asset types

4. **User Experience Complexity**:
   - The application has many features and options
   - Need to ensure the user interface remains intuitive despite the complexity

5. **Responsive Layout Challenges**:
   - Ensuring components adapt properly to different screen sizes
   - Maintaining usability of data-dense visualizations on smaller screens
   - Current approach: Moving from fixed-width components to responsive designs and grid-based layouts
