## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **State Management Approach**:
   - Considering Redux vs. Zustand for state management in the frontend
   - Need to evaluate the complexity of the application state and the team's familiarity with each option
   - Decision pending: Will likely choose based on the team's experience and the specific requirements of the application

2. **API Design**:
   - Considering the granularity of API endpoints
   - Evaluating the trade-offs between fewer, more complex endpoints vs. more numerous, simpler endpoints
   - Decision pending: Will likely implement a balanced approach based on the specific use cases

3. **Search Implementation**:
   - Evaluating MySQL's full-text search capabilities vs. dedicated search solutions
   - Considering the performance implications for large datasets
   - Decision pending: Will start with MySQL's built-in capabilities and evaluate performance

### UX Considerations


2. **Results Presentation**:
   - Considering different approaches to presenting search results
   - Evaluating the balance between information density and clarity
   - Decision pending: Will create wireframes and prototypes to test different approaches

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Considering the approach to mobile responsiveness
   - Evaluating whether to use a mobile-first approach or adapt the desktop design
   - Decision pending: Will likely adopt a mobile-first approach for core functionality

### Data Considerations

1. **Mock Data Strategy**:
   - Need to create realistic mock data for development and testing
   - Considering approaches to generating diverse and representative financial instrument data
   - Decision pending: Will likely implement a data generation utility that creates realistic financial data

2. **Data Update Frequency**:
   - Considering how frequently to update financial data in a production environment
   - Evaluating the trade-offs between real-time data and system performance
   - Decision pending: Will likely implement a configurable update schedule based on the importance of each data type

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Considering the approach to validating financial data
   - Evaluating the balance between strict validation and flexibility
   - Decision pending: Will implement validation rules based on the specific requirements of each data type

## Current Challenges

1. **Complex Filtering Requirements**:
   - The application requires sophisticated filtering across multiple dimensions
   - Need to design a flexible and performant filtering system
   - Approach: Will implement a modular filtering system that can be extended as needed

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**:
   - Financial data can be voluminous, especially historical data
   - Need to ensure good performance even with large datasets
   - Approach: Will implement pagination, efficient indexing, and consider caching strategies

3. **Cross-Asset Comparison**:
   - Different asset types have different attributes and metrics
   - Need to design a system that allows meaningful comparison across asset types
   - Approach: Will identify common metrics and implement asset-specific comparison logic where needed

4. **User Experience Complexity**:
   - The application has many features and options
   - Need to ensure the user interface remains intuitive despite the complexity
   - Approach: Will focus on progressive disclosure and clear information hierarchy

## Team Coordination
